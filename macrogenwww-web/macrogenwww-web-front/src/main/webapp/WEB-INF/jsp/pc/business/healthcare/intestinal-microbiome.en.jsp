                <p class="subject">Microbiome is garnering much attention to the extent it is dubbed "the second genome." Research has found that the microbiome influences various aspects<br>
					of the human body, including metabolism, digestion, response to diseases, and immunity. Indeed, it was found that 90% of diseases have to do with<br>
					microbiome health.<br>
					<br>
					Gut microbiome keeps changing according to the person's eating habits and lifestyle. Bad habits can lead to an increase in harmful bacteria and a decrease in<br>
					beneficial bacteria in one's gut, undermining gut health. It is essential to check the microbiome's health in the gut and replenish beneficial bacteria to maintain<br>
					one's gut health.
