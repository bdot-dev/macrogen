	                    Spatial gene expression analysis is the latest genetic sequencing technology, which simultaneously assesses the genetic information of cells and the location of the cells. It can directly analyze the gene expression of the tissue itself without separation into single cells or RNA extraction. By doing so, you can understand the tissue heterogeneity at the same time by obtaining the unique location information of cells in the tissue, as well as the gene expression information. In addition, it has the advantage of being able to be applied to both the fresh tissue obtained from surgery and FFPE tissue treated with formalin to store the tissue. By analyzing genetic information and tissue location information at once, you can set a direction for treatment or predict efficacy. For example, by checking the genetic information and location of the cancer patient's immune cells and cancer cells, you can determine how effective treatment is, whether cancer cells have metastasized, and the expected prognosis of the treatment.
